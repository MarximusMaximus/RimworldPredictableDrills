    <description>Deep drills drill up the rocks they're sitting on!

In vanilla, Deep Drills produce stone chunks if they don't have any deep pockets under them.  The type of chunk is a random type of natural stone on your map.  Annoyingly, this means a drill on granite might produce marble, while a drill on marble produces granite.  If you want a specific kind of chunk, you have to keep moving your drills until you find a square that makes it.

Not anymore!  If you put your deep drills on a patch of granite, the drill will dig up granite chunks, simple as that!  If you put them on dirt or sand or any other kind of terrain, they'll continue to drill up the random kind of stone they always have.

For balance reasons, by default only natural stone types of your map will produce their own chunks, just as it is in vanilla.  If your map naturally has granite and slate, a marble meteorite might leave some marble terrain, but digging it up will randomly produce either granite or slate chunks only.  Likewise, by default deep drills won't be able to dig up chunks at all on sea ice maps.  There are settings to change both of these behaviors, if you prefer.</description>
